# vault-demo

This repository will provision an instance running a HashiCorp Vault demo application. The Vault demo application is described [here](https://github.com/assareh/transit-app-example).

To use, check out, update the prefix variable to your name and run:
```
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
Please be patient, it does take a little while to configure!
